## Code Snippet üíª

JavaScript

Function to query database and allow user to view the total utilized budget of a department

```JavaScript
function budgetUtilized (){
db.query (
  `SELECT DISTINCT name from department`, (err,result) =>{
  if (err) throw err;
  inquirer.prompt({
        name: "department",
        type: "list",
        message: "Which department would you like to view?",
        choices: () =>
        result.map((result) => result.name),
        })
        .then ((answer) => {
          db.query (
          `SELECT name AS department, SUM(salary) AS utilized_budget
          FROM employee
          LEFT JOIN role
          ON employee.role_id = role.id
          LEFT JOIN department
          ON role.department_id = department.id
          WHERE name = "${answer.department}"
          GROUP BY name`, (err,finalResult) =>{
            if (err) throw err;
            console.table("The combined salaries of all employees in " + answer.department + " department is:", finalResult);
            initPrompt();
        })
  })
})
}
```

Function to prompt user and lelete roles from database

```JavaScript
function deleteRole () {
  db.query("SELECT DISTINCT title FROM role", (err, result) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    inquirer.prompt({
        name: "title",
        type: "list",
        message: "Which role would you like to delete?",
        choices: () => 
          result.map((result) => result.title)
      })
      .then ((answer) => {
      db.query(`SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;
      DELETE FROM role WHERE ?`, {title: answer.title},
          (err, result) => {
              if (err) throw err;
              console.log(
                "Successfully deleted the " + answer.title + " role."
              );
              initPrompt();
          });
      })
  })
}
```

## Installation üó≥ 

- Download or clone repository to use this application on local machine.
- Node.js is required to run the application
- To install necessary dependencies, run the following command :
>    `npm i`

## Usage üí°

After installation :

1. Run `node index.js` in terminal to start. 
2. Follow through the prompts as required. 

Note:

- Need to be in the main folder in terminal when running the command.
- If you choose not to use the dummy data, I recommend create your own database from scratch.
- I recommend first creating the table for departments, then the roles within each departments, and then the employees.
- This is important becasue "add", "delete" and "view by" are prompted by lists generated from database.
